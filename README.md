# splunk-security-dashboard
This project showcases a dynamic security monitoring dashboard built using Splunk, a powerful platform for log management and analysis. The dashboard provides insights into network security by analyzing destination and source port activity, along with actionable alerts for potential security incidents.  

1.Key Features:
A.Destination Port vs. Deny Action Count: Visualizes the distribution of denied actions across different destination ports, enabling quick identification of potentially malicious activities targeting specific ports.

B.Source Port vs. Deny Count: Analyzes the frequency of denied actions originating from various source ports, facilitating the detection of suspicious outbound traffic patterns.

C.Real-time Action Alerts: Implements alerts based on predefined thresholds, triggering notifications for anomalous network activities such as port scanning, excessive failed connection attempts, or unusual data transfers.

2.Why Splunk in Cybersecurity?

Splunk plays a critical role in cybersecurity by providing real-time visibility into network activities, facilitating proactive threat detection, and enabling rapid incident response. Its advanced analytics capabilities allow security professionals to monitor, analyze, and correlate vast amounts of log data from diverse sources, empowering organizations to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
